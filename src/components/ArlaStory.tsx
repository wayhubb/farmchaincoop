            From 12 Farmers to €13bn Global Brand—How Arla Did It

            <p className="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              In 1882, twelve Danish dairy farmers pooled milk into one shared creamery. They standardised feed, bought vaccines in bulk, built cold-chain routes, and sold cartons under a single brand. Today, Arla has 12,000 farmer-owners, €13 bn turnover, and shelves from Lagos to London.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">
              The trick? A cooperative common-facility model: farmers own the animals. Arla owns the plants. Everyone shares the NET profit after costs.

                Nigeria eats <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">1.2 billion kg of beef yearly</span>—yet imports 25%. Why? Because 85% of our beef comes from 24-month pastoral treks with 12% weight loss and 8% mortality. Because middle-men control pricing. Because no one can prove where your steak came from.

Walmart, Carrefour, JD.com already demand it. Dubai shelves pay <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">40% more</span> for traced beef. Recall time drops from 7 days to 2.3 seconds.
